## Introduction
My name is Kiana and I am in tenth grade. My favorite movie is taken because I like heist, terrorist, and action movies. A new skill ive learned is how to fluetly speak Turkish.A personal achivement ive accomplished is going to 10 countries in one year. My goals for the school year is to successfully pass all my AP tests and complete all my classes with A without getting burntout. One travel experience I had was when I went to Greece and went to a beach with salt instead of sand which was said to be really good for your joints. My favorite food is pasta because you can eat it plain or add any sauce of your desire and it would taste good, and very easily customizable.
