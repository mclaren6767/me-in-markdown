## Introduction
    My name is Kiana and I am in tenth grade. My favorite movie is taken because I like heist, terrorist, and action movies. A new skill ive learned is how to fluetly speak Turkish. A personal achivement ive accomplished is going to 10 countries in one year. My goals for the school year is to successfully pass all my AP tests and complete all my classes with A without getting burntout. 
  
    One travel experience I had was when I went to Greece and went to a beach with salt instead of sand which was said to be really good for your joints. My favorite food is pasta because you can eat it plain or add any sauce of your desire and it would taste good, and very easily customizable. Some expectations I have for the class is that it will allow me to learn new skilsl regarding coding and computers. My most memorable experience would have to be when I went to Turkey and ate at this doner kebab place because the food was just that good. Some tech projects that I have completed recently would have to be developing a roblox game. 
    
    A sport activity that I engaged in would be beach volleyball and inside volleyball which was very fun since they are simillar but completely different. A creative activiy or endevaor would have to be when I had collected sand and a couple rocks from certain beaches ive went to and made a painting with it. Some volunteering hours that ive done was going to my old middle school for a tech fair and seeing all my old teachers and the new campus. A family tradition I partaked in would have to be going to TUrkey every year because it was the last place my grandma wanted to visit and we go there to commerate her after her death. A favorite memory I made with my friends this summer was going to my freinds pool with a bunch of people ordering foods and drinks and hanging out until sunsent and just chilling.
